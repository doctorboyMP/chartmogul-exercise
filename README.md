# ChartMogul API Exercise

This repository includes my personal resolution for an optional exercise that was proposed to me as part of a job application for a Product Manager role on Chart Mogul.

I've created a python script and a jupyter lab file for better readability.
You can use [Binder](https://mybinder.org/) service to turn this repo into an interactive jupyter notebook in your browser.

## Exercise:
Using a ChartMogul account and a previously created dataset, create a script that will retrieve the MRR of your account for January 2019 - April 2019. Imagine that this will be displayed on dashboard screens in an office for all employees to see.

Output the information using this format:

	Total MRR for Q1 2019:
  
	January:
	February:
	March:
	April:

Note: You can use any programming language of your choice. We also have client libraries for Ruby, Node.js, PHP, Go and Python that you can use. See https://dev.chartmogul.com/docs/client-libraries
